 -  Scenario Outline: Daily attendance fees derived from actual length of Trial
 -  Given I am a signed in advocate
 -    And There are case types in place
 -    And I am on the new claim page with Daily Attendance Fees in place
 -    And I select2 a Case Type of "Trial"
 -    And I fill in actual trial length with <actual_trial_length>
 -   Then The daily attendance fields should have quantities <daf_quantity>, <dah_quantity>, <daj_quantity>
 -
 -  Examples: Actual Trial lengths and how the Daily attendance fields should break it down
 -    | actual_trial_length   | daf_quantity | dah_quantity | daj_quantity |
