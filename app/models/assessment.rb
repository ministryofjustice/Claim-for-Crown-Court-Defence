# The Assessment class represents the first assessment the case workers make on a claim. Any subsequent assessments are
# called determinations. There can be many determinations per claim, but only one assessment.  An assessment with zero
# values (blank? returns true) is created automatically when the claim is created.
#
# The correct way to create a non-blank assessment for a claim is to call #update_values on the blank Assessment that
# is created when the claim is created.  This will raise an error if the assessment is not blank.
# The #update_values! (note the bang) can be used in testing and will not raise if the assessment already has values.
