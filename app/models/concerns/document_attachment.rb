    # This is an attempt to recreate how the preview PDF was created with
    # Paperclip. However, it is accessing the original file in an
    # undocumented way and so may change with future versions of Rails. It
    # is done in this way because the file is not accessible to Active
    # Storage until after the `save` but this conversion is being done
    # before.
    #
    # Possible alternatives are:
    #
    # 1) Convert the file in a background job.
    # 2) Use the built-in Active Storage Previewer functionality, although
    #    this may not behave in exactly the same way.
    #
    # Either of these would have the advantage of reducing the response time
    # when a new file is added.
