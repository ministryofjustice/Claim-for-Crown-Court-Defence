      To facilitate the lookup of offences the unique identifiers that

        %code.code='id'

        The reason for this is that internal id's could change unexpectedly. We will, however,
        endeavour to not change these for historical reasons. Instead an offence should be queried
        on this endpoint using the
        %code.code='unique_code'
        identifier (or description, but this too is not ideal) to retrieve its id.

        An

      In addition a
      %code.code='unique_code'

      The endpoints are functionally identical, so you will just need to POST to the new endpoint or its

        curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' &&
        'https://api-sandbox-adp.dsd.io/api/fee_types?api_key=[your-api-key]&role=lgfs&category=misc'
      %br/
      This is being done as part of fee calculation integration into the CCCD web application. We are applying defendant uplifts to LGFS graduated, transfer and interim
      fees based on the number of defendants supplied on the claim.
      %br/
      %br/
      As a result the Miscellaneous fee type of Defendant uplift is no longer
      required and is being removed from the web interface for these fees. It
      is solely available for use in respect of LGFS final fixed fee claims.
      %br/
      %br/
      API submitted fees of this type will continue to be created, even for inapplicable/ineligible claim types, but could result in double claiming of defendant uplifts and rejection by case workers.
      %br/
      %br/
      API consuming software should apply defendant uplifts as part of the graduated
      fee amount, transfer fee amount or interim fee amount as applicable.

      Implementation of LGFS fixed fee calculation.
      %br/
      %br/
      The CCCD web interface has been amended to calculate LGFS fixed fees. As part of this work the interface
      has (re)introduced the
      %code.code
        quantity
      and
      %code.code
        rate
      attributes for all
      %code.code
        LGFS Fee::FixedFeeType
      fee objects. The
      %code.code
        amount
      attribute will be calculated on a simple quantity x rate basis.
      %br/
      %br/
      The interface will populate the
      %code.code
        rate
      attribute by querying the
      %a{:href => 'https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-fee-calculator', target: '_blank'}
        LAA fee calculation API
      \. The
      %code.code
        quantity
      is required.
      %br/
      %br/
      Any API consumers (applications) that POST LGFS fixed fees with an amount, but no rate and
      quantity will default the quantity to 1 and rate to the amount provided.
      %br/
      %br/
      For example:
      %br/
      %pre.code
        {
        &nbsp;api_key: you-provider-api-key,
        &nbsp;claim_id: claim-uuid,
        &nbsp;fee_type_id: fixed-fee-type-id,
        &nbsp;date: "2018-04-19",
        &nbsp;amount: 349.47
        }
      %br/
      will result in a fixed fee with the following attributes:
      %br/
      %pre.code
        {
        &ensp;claim_id: claim-uuid,
        &ensp;fee_type_id: fixed-fee-type-id,
        &ensp;date: "2018-04-19",
        &ensp;quantity: 1
        &ensp;rate: 349.47
        &ensp;amount: 349.47}
        }
      %br/
      %br/
      Long term, API consumers should look to provide quantity and rate separately where quantity represents the number of days (in court) typically.

      The LGFS Miscellaneous fee "Case uplift" is being repurposed as a "Defendant uplift"
      %br/

      This release changes the LGFS only miscellaneous fee type "Case uplift" with a unique code of
      %code.code
        MIUPL
      to be a Defendant uplift. This means the fee no longer requires case numbers to be supplied.
      %br/
      %br/
      This change encapsulates two distinct changes, namely, Case uplifts are not applicable to LGFS
      claims and Defendant uplifts can be claimed.

      A new claim type was introduced as part of the AGFS fee scheme changes on 1st April 2018. This has been implemented on the API as
      %code.code
        \/api/external_users/claims/advocates/interim
      and enables a submission of a warrant fee.
      Please see the
      =link_to 'Crown Court Fee Guidance', 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/696617/crown-court-fee-guidance.-post-1-apr-2018.pdf'
      for details.
      %br/
      %br/
      This has a reduced set of fields as the claim will never require a case type value or trial dates.  We have also taken the opportunity to remove the deprecated
      %code.code
        advocate_email
      field.
      %br/
      %br/
      There is the usual
      %code.code
        \/api/external_users/claims/advocates/interim/validate

      Due to the implementation of AGFS fee scheme 10 in April 2018 significant changes to the offence list are needed.
      %br/

      This release adds the new 1244 AGFS offences to the existing offences list, but starting from 1000.  Therefore the
      %code.code
        \/api/external_users/offences

      When left empty or submitted with a date prior to the start of scheme 10, this will return the current offences from AGFS scheme 9.
