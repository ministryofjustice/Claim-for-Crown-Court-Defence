# By default, Sidekiq tries to connect to Redis at localhost:6379
#
# You can also set the Redis url using environment variables.
# The generic REDIS_URL may be set to specify the Redis server.
#
# Otherwise it can be configured here using both the blocks
# Sidekiq.configure_server and Sidekiq.configure_client

# so you don't have to run a separate process.
# You'll also benefit from code reloading.
