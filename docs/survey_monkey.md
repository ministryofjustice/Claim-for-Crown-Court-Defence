# Survey Monkey

## Survey configuration

Submitting survey results to Survey Monkey requires the following details:

* Access token
* Collector id
* Question ids

### Access token

The auth token can be found from the [developer dashboard](https://developer.eu.surveymonkey.com/apps/)
inside the settings for an app. This is used for `SURVEY_MONKEY_BEARER_TOKEN`
and as the bearer token for fetching ids, below.

### Survey id

The id of a survey is required to fetch the collector ids and question ids,
below. A list of all surveys can be found with:

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.eu.surveymonkey.com/v3/surveys \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access token>' \
     | jq
```

This will return

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "230446645",
      "title": "Claim for Crown Court Defence Feedback",
      "nickname": "",
      "href": "https://api.eu.surveymonkey.com/v3/surveys/230446645"
    },
    {
      "id": "230500260",
      "title": "Data feed from Common Platform into Claim for Crown Court Defence - feedback survey",
      "nickname": "",
      "href": "https://api.eu.surveymonkey.com/v3/surveys/230500260"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "per_page": 50,
  "page": 1,
  "total": 11,
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api.eu.surveymonkey.com/v3/surveys?per_page=50&page=1"
  }
}
```

This id in the `data` section corresponding to the correct survey is used in
the requests to fetch collector id and question ids below.

### Collector id

One or more collector ids are set up for each survey and this can be used to
separate submissions to the same survey from different sources, such a the
production and development environments. To find the list of all collectors for
a survey:

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.eu.surveymonkey.com/v3/surveys/<survey id>/collectors \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access token>' \
     | jq
```

This will return data like:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Embedded Survey 1",
      "id": "330288407",
      "href": "https://api.eu.surveymonkey.com/v3/collectors/330288407",
      "type": "popup"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "per_page": 50,
  "page": 1,
  "total": 3,
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api.eu.surveymonkey.com/v3/surveys/230446645/collectors?per_page=50&page=1"
  }
}
```

The collector is registered with the SurveyMonkey module with:

```ruby
config.register_collector(:feedback, id: <collector id>)
```

and then the label given to the collector (e.g. `:feedback`) is set as the
`collector` attribute for the form page class.

See:
* `config/initializers/survey_monkey.rb`
* `app/forms/feedback_form.rb`

### Question ids

The question ids for a survey can be found from the details of the survey:

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.eu.surveymonkey.com/v3/surveys/<survey id>/details \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access token>' \
     | jq
```

This will return data like:

```json

  "title": "Claim for Crown Court Defence Feedback",
  ...
  "pages": [
    {
      "title": "",
      "description": "",

    }
  ]
}
```

This contains question ids as well as option ids, as appropriate. These ids
need to be added to the correct form page class. See, for example,
`app/forms/feedback_form.rb`.
