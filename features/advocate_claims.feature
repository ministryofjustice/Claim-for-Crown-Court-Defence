Feature: Advocate Claims
  Scenario: Make a claim
    Given I am a signed in advocate
      And I am on the new claim page
     When I select a court and fill in the defendant details
      And I submit the form
     Then I should be redirected to the claim summary page
      And I should see the claim total
