    Given I am a signed in advocate
    And I sign out
    Then I should be redirected to the feedback page
    And I should be informed that I have signed out
    Then I should not see 'What is your email address?'
    When I fill in the 'feedback' form
    Then I expect ZendeskSender to receive a description with an email
    And I see confirmation that my 'feedback' was received
    And I should be on the sign in page

    Then I expect ZendeskSender to receive a description without an email
    And I see confirmation that my 'feedback' was received
