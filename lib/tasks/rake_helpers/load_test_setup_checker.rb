          ERROR! tsung-wrapper not found!

          In order to run the load test for ADP, you need to have the tsung-wrapper repo
          installed at #{WRAPPER_DIR}.

          To install the repo, cd to #{PARENT_DIR} and
          execute 'git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/tsung-wrapper.git'.

          You will also need to install Erlang, and Perl Template toolkit. See the
          README file tsung_wrapper repo for installation details.

          ERROR! Unable to find XML config file for load test

          The load test needs an XML config file to run, and was expected to be located at
          #{XML_CONFIG}, but there is no such file.

          The file can be reconstructed by following these steps:

          - In the tsung-wrapper directory, execute "ruby tsung_runner.rb".

          - In response to the question "Select task", select "Generate session XML".

          - In response to the question "Select the project you want to load test", select "adp".

          - In response to the question "Select the environment to use", select "staging".

          - In response to the question "Select the load_profile to use", select "gradual".

          - In response to the question "Select the session to run", select "create_guilty_plea"

        This will regenerate the XML config file, and then you will be able to run this rake task again.

        Have you built and deployed a version of the app without CSRF protection?

        You are about to start a load test on staging.  The load test requires that CSRF
        protection is disabled.  In order to do this, you need to:

        - Build a version of the app in Jenkins, setting the DISABLE_CSRF flag to 1

        - Deploy that build to staging
